**AxiorBot** is an automatic work with a caterpillar drive on two motors. The main software is Raspberry Pi 4 B, running Ubuntu Server 22.04 and ROS 2 software (ROS Humble). This repository contains ros packages, a hardware PC management interface for a real robot, and configurations for visualizing data from sensors.

The robot was developed as part of the course "Spatial Orientation Algorithms" at ITMO University.

It is intended to be an educational reasearch project, so, among our goals is to maintain a rich set of study materials and detailed [documentation](https://github.com/ITMO-Robotics-Group/axior_software/tree/main/docs). -->
